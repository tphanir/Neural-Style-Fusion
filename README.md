# Neural Style Fusion

## Objective
The aim of the project was to implement the **Neural Style Transfer** Algorithm using the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Approach
1. The project started with understanding the of Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks.
2. With the knowledge of Gradient Descent Algorithm and other primary concepts, we trained a Two Layer Neural Network on MNIST Dataset to classify digits, from scratch using Numpy.
3. Next, we learnt many Optimization Algorithms and tuning of Hyperparameters to refine the Neural Network.Further, we implemented a more efficient Neural Network using the PyTorch Framework to classify the digits.
